			The game <strong>Diki Kong Banana Hero Dk</strong> was developed using the framework Phaser. The game can be viewed on almost all browsers. Included is touch, and can be opened in mobile phones and tablets.
            <br>
			The game has 14 levels, that gradually become more difficult. The game contains sfx and soundtrack (only for desktop version not for mobile). The ZIP package contains 2 different version + plugin "wordpress" for game. 
			 <br>

            The game also is auto-resizable! 
			<br>
			The game was developed in resolution <strong>950x630px</strong>. You can use any size in height and width, but it gets better in the original resolution. Another suggestion  in mobile version is <strong>736x414px</strong> resolution, - very friendly(Ipad - Iphone 7/8/9 - Plus IOS 11).<br>
			<br>
            Tip: Always use the latest version of the framework Phaser is more stable.

			<br>
			Sprite sheets are a useful mechanism for slicing up image resources into separate sprites or for generating in game animations.<br> 
			Sprites are organized in row major order in the SpriteSheet.<br>
			<br>
			To create a SpriteSheet you need a loaded Texture resource.<br>
			The game contains 'one hero' and 'various enemy' spritesheets that you can edit if you want to change the graphic and game.
            <br>
			 <br>
            <img src="images/img_10.png">
            <br>
			To edit the images(spritesheet) of the game, no need to leave the program. Just replace them. Follow the steps below. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Creating animations</strong>
            <br>
			SpriteSheets provide a quick way to generate a new Animation instance.<br>

           You can use all the frames of a Texture (SpriteSheet) <br>
		    or you can use a range of frames.<br>
           To create an Animation these methods must be passed an instance of Engine.<br>
		   It's recommended to generate animations for an Actor in  event because the Engine is passed to the initialization function.<br>
		   However, if your Engine instance is in the global scope, you can create an Animation at any time provided the Texture has been loaded.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/img_11.png">
            <br>
             <img src="images/img_12.png">
            <br>
			<br>
			<strong>Multiple rows.</strong>
			<br>
           Sheets are organized in "row major order" which means left-to-right, <br>
		    top-to-bottom. Indexes are zero-based, so while you might think to yourself<br> 
		    the first column is column "1", to the engine it is column "0".<br>
			<br>
			<br>
            <strong>Important: You should always make a backup before editing, because you may want to recover the original file.</strong>

			During the setup is included the Phaser library game.js in our HTML file. <br>
			This gives us a global object called Phaser.<br>
			Through it, you can access the library's methods and functions for building games.<br>
           Now we you can use the global Phaser object, and create a new game instance. <br>
		   This is an object which represents our entire game. We will add the states to it.<br>

			<br>
            <img src="images/img_15.png"><br>

			<strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp; The first thing you need to do for any game is create a game object.<br>
			This is the 'interest' point of our game and sets up the game settings before it is run.<br>
			Before we do that, you need to create a scene that our Game can use.<br>
			A scene is basically a set of functions which are called at various points during the game.

			<strong>HTML5 Audio implementation of the Sound Manager.</strong><br>
			<br>
			By far the most difficult platforms to provide web audio support for are mobile platforms.<br>
			Unfortunately these are also the platforms that people often use to play games.<br>
			There are a couple of differences between desktop and mobile browsers that may have caused 
			browser vendors to make choices that can make web audio difficult for game developers to work with. <br>
			
           To play multiple instances of the same HTML5 Audio sound,
		    you need to provide an instances value when loading the sound with the Loader.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/img_20.png">
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Autoplay</strong>
			<br>
			Browser autoplay policy now affects desktop and mobile browsers.<br> 
			There is further information about it here from the <a href ="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes" target="_blank">Google Developers site.</a><br>
           It is worth noting that autoplay with sound is allowed if:<br>
           <br>
           --> the User has interacted with the domain.<br>
		   <br>
           --> on mobile the user has <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Add_to_home_screen" target="_blank">added the site to their home screen.</a><br>
           <br>
		   Many browsers will simply ignore any requests made by your game to automatically play audio;<br>
		   instead playback for audio needs to be started by a user-initiated event, such as a click or tap.<br>
		   This means you will have to structure your audio playback to take account of that.<br>
		   This is usually mitigated against by loading the audio in advance and priming it on a user-initiated event.<br>
          For more passive audio auto play, for example background music that starts as soon as a game loads, <br>
		  one trick is to detect any user initiated event and start playback then. For other more active sounds <br> 
		  that are to be used during the game we could consider priming them as soon as something like a "Start" button is pressed.<br>

			Once again, thank you so much for purchasing this game. As I said at the beginning, I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this files. No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. If you have a more general question relating to the games,
you might consider visiting the forums.
